# Word-Matrix-Play

The problem of finding whether a graph is word-representable is NP-complete. The purpose of this study is to categorize classes of graphs as word-representable or non-word-representable, we therefore devised a tool in C++ for the same. The current implementation focusses on the specific orientation of the graph, it further can be enhanced to check if all orientations of a graph are word-representable or not. This will increase the time complexity further more.

Alongside, a C++ implementation to list the alternating pairs of letters of a given word and its corresponding graph is developed. With the help of these tools, we can further enumerate the number of word-representable graphs or characterize various classes of graphs, as well as analyse the enumerated data.
